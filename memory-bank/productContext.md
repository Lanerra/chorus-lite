# **Product Context: Chorus-Lite**

## **Why This Project Exists**

Novel writing is a complex, multi-stage creative process requiring consistent world-building, character development, and narrative coherence. Existing tools focus on either AI-assisted writing (without structured collaboration) or manual writing processes (requiring significant human effort). Chorus-Lite bridges this gap by creating an autonomous, agent-based system that manages the entire novel-writing workflow while maintaining strict narrative consistency.

## **Core Problems Solved**

1. **Narrative Inconsistency**: Traditional AI writing tools often lose track of character traits, plot points, and world rules across long documents.
2. **Creative Process Fragmentation**: Writers must manually manage multiple tools for outlining, scene generation, and editing.
3. **Lack of Autonomy**: Current systems require constant human intervention to guide the writing process.

## **User Experience Goals**

- **Seamless Workflow**: Users provide a high-level concept and receive a complete novel with minimal ongoing input.
- **Real-Time Transparency**: Web interface shows agent progress and story state without requiring technical knowledge.
- **Resumable Process**: Writing can be paused and resumed without losing context or requiring manual state management.
- **Coherence Guarantee**: System actively prevents contradictions in character behavior, plot points, and world rules.
