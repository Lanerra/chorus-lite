# Chorus-Lite Progress

## What Works
- Three-agent architecture is effectively managing the creative writing workflow
- LangGraph provides robust state management and error recovery
- PostgreSQL with pgvector enables efficient storage and retrieval of story data
- Web interface provides real-time monitoring through WebSocket streaming
- Async-first design ensures optimal performance for I/O-bound operations

## What's Left to Build
- Complete documentation of all memory bank files
- Final verification of all system patterns against current implementation
- Comprehensive testing of the entire workflow from concept to completed story

## Current Status
- Memory bank files are being systematically updated to reflect the current system state
- All core components are implemented and functional
- System architecture is stable and working as designed

## Known Issues
- Documentation gaps between tech-docs.md and memory bank files
- Some agent responsibilities could be further refined for optimal performance
- Error recovery strategies need thorough testing under various failure scenarios

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Simplified from four-agent to three-agent architecture for reduced complexity
2. Adopted LangGraph for workflow management over custom state machines
3. Selected PostgreSQL with pgvector for canonical storage and vector search
4. Implemented async-first design for optimal performance
5. Added structured output validation using Pydantic models throughout

## Next Steps
1. Update systemPatterns.md with detailed error handling strategy documentation
2. Document memory management pattern specifics in systemPatterns.md
3. Verify projectbrief.md alignment with current architecture
4. Complete remaining memory bank files (techContext.md, activeContext.md)
5. Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire workflow
