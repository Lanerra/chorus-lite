# Chorus-Lite Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Integrating comprehensive technical documentation from `docs/tech-docs.md` into memory bank files
- Updating `techContext.md` and `systemPatterns.md` with detailed system architecture, components, and patterns
- Ensuring all memory bank files reflect the latest project context for improved maintainability

## Recent Changes
- Added detailed core technologies and development setup to `techContext.md`
- Documented architectural patterns, error handling strategies, and critical design decisions in `systemPatterns.md`
- Integrated database schema details and configuration management practices

## Next Steps
- Update `productContext.md` to reflect new technical capabilities and limitations
- Review and update `projectbrief.md` with any changes to core requirements based on documentation
- Verify all memory bank files are consistent with current codebase state

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Async-First Architecture**: All I/O operations use async/await
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic models for data validation throughout
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Workflow management with error recovery
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: For canonical storage and vector search

## Key Learnings
- The three-agent architecture is well-suited for the creative writing workflow
- LangGraph provides robust state management and error recovery
- Database schema design supports efficient story data storage and retrieval
