# **Progress: Chorus-Lite**

## **What Works**
- Memory Bank initialized with core documentation files
- Project brief and context established
- System architecture patterns documented
- Tech stack and setup details captured

## **What's Left to Build**
- Completion of memory bank documentation
- Integration of memory bank into development workflow
- Documentation of initial agent implementation patterns

## **Current Status**
- Memory Bank initialization complete (all core files created)
- Project context fully established for future development
- Architecture and tech stack documented for reference

## **Known Issues**
- None identified at this stage

## **Evolution of Project Decisions**
- Initial focus on foundational documentation before implementation
- Structured approach to Memory Bank ensures maintainable context
- Documentation follows precise patterns for consistency
- All files created incrementally as work progresses
